		<p id="image_text"> 
		Hypotheses for the etymology of the name <q>Italia</q> are numerous.One is that it was borrowed via Greek from the Oscan Víteliú <q>land of calves</q><br> 
		Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus mentioned also by Aristotle and Thucydides.<br>
		<br>
		According to Antiochus of Syracuse, the term Italy was used by the Greeks to initially refer only to the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the modern<br>
		province of Reggio and part of the provinces of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia in southern Italy. Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of Oenotria and Italy had become<br>
		synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. According to Strabo's Geographica, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by<br>
		Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto, corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria.<br>
		The borders of Roman Italy, Italia, are better established. Cato's Origines, the first work of history composed in Latin, described Italy as the entire peninsula south of the Alps.<br>
		According to Cato and several Roman authors, the Alps formed the "walls of Italy". In 264 BC, Roman Italy extended from the Arno and Rubicon rivers of the centre-north to the entire south.<br>
		The northern area of Cisalpine Gaul was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC and became considered geographically and de facto part of Italy, but remained politically and de jure separated.<br>
		It was legally merged into the administrative unit of Italy in 42 BC by the triumvir Octavian as a ratification of Caesar's unpublished acts (Acta Caesaris).<br>
		The islands of Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily and Malta were added to Italy by Diocletian in 292 AD.

		Thousands of Lower Paleolithic artifacts have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo, dating as far back as 850,000 years Excavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal<br>
		presence dating back to the Middle Palaeolithic period some 200,000 years ago while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi. Archaeological sites <br>
		from this period include Addaura cave, Altamura, Ceprano, and Gravina in Puglia.<br>
