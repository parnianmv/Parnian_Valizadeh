	<p> <small>
	Hypotheses for the etymology of the name <q>Italia</q> are numerous.One is that it was borrowed via Greek from the Oscan Víteliú <q>land of calves</q><br> 
	Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus mentioned also by Aristotle and Thucydides.<br>
	<br>
	According to Antiochus of Syracuse, the term Italy was used by the Greeks to initially refer only to the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the modern<br>
	province of Reggio and part of the provinces of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia in southern Italy. Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of Oenotria and Italy had become<br>
	synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. According to Strabo's Geographica, before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by<br>
	Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto, corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria.<br>
